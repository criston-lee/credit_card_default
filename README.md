# Credit Card Default

# Context
This was the first data science project that I worked on. It was done as part of an individiual assignment as part of our module BC3409 AI in Accounting and Finance. 

# Importance of Project
This project that was done is to predict whether a customer would default on their loan in the future (specifically next month) based on their personal information, and past history using a machine learning model.

This is important to the bank for 2 main reasons:

1. It helps banks to minimise their credit risk by identifying customers who are more likely to default and not grant them loans, leading to minimised monetary loss for the bank. By identifying these people, the bank could decide to avoid loaning them money altogether, or change them an increased interest rate in response to compensate for the additional risk incurred. This is proactive credit risk management, enabling the bank to intervene at the earliest opportunity so that they have more options for remedying the situation and mitigating / avoiding losses.
2. It helps the bank make better lending decisions based on multiple predictors, and is more accurate than traditional methods like looking at credit risk or income levels. A predictive model takes into consideration multiple factors like demographics, gender, employment history etc. to come to a decision based on correlations that humans cannot detect as accurately. 

# Dataset
The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset.

# Future Improvements

Future studies could:
1. Balance out the dataset and predictors, not limited to the "default payment next month" column. This would allow the dataset to be balanced and increase the accuracy of model.
2. Adding additional variables as customer's net income, credit score, etc. 
3. If deciding to use models such as neural network, gradient boosting, random forest, include explanations and justifications for decisions made so the decision-making process would be easier to understand and explain to a layman. 
4. Consider colinearity issues / clustering and eliminate unnecessary or excess predictors where applicable. 
5. Model maintainence to ensure that performance of the model is up to baseline standard, accomodating changes in the customers profile / spending habits etc. 
6. Hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy of models.
